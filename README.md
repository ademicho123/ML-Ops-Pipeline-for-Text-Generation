# ML-Ops-Pipeline-for-Text-Generation

This project aims to deploy and evaluate a text-generation language model (LLM) using Amazon SageMaker for deployment and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). The pipeline includes monitoring, logging, and performance evaluation using BLEU score.

# Explanation:
# llm_model.py: 
This script deploys the text-generation language model using Amazon SageMaker. It connects to a given AWS account, specifies the model location, and deploys it to an endpoint.

# monitoring_logging/llm_monitoring_setup.py: 
This script sets up monitoring and logging for the deployed model using Amazon CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and AWS CloudTrail for logging API calls. Adjustments can be made based on specific metrics and logging requirements.

# performance_monitor/performance_eval.py: 
This script evaluates the performance of the text-generation model using BLEU score, comparing the model's output to a baseline output. Adjust the script based on your specific evaluation criteria.

# .github/workflows/ci_cd_workflow/llm_model.yml: 
This GitHub Actions workflow is triggered on pushes to the main branch. It automates the deployment process, running linting, testing, and the model deployment script.

# requirements.txt: 
This file lists the Python dependencies for your this project. It includes libraries like boto3 for AWS interactions and nltk for BLEU score calculation.

# README.md: 
The README file provides detailed instructions and documentation for setting up and using the project. It includes information on prerequisites, installation, configuration, and usage.

# Setup Instructions:

Follow these steps to set up and use the project:

# AWS Setup:

# 1. Create an AWS account if you don't have one.
- Set up an IAM role with the necessary permissions for SageMaker, CloudWatch, and CloudTrail.
- Retrieve your AWS access key and secret key.
# 2. OpenAI Setup:
- Obtain an API key from OpenAI to use the GPT model.
- Replace placeholders in the scripts with your AWS credentials and OpenAI API key.
# 3. GitHub Setup:
- Create a new GitHub repository.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
# 4. Local Environment Setup:
- Install Python and pip.
- Create a virtual environment.
- Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
# 5. AWS SageMaker Deployment:
- Train your text-generation model and store artifacts in an S3 bucket.
- Update deploy_model.py with the S3 path and model configurations.
- Run python deploy_model.py to deploy the model to SageMaker.
# 6. GitHub Actions Setup:
- Add AWS credentials as secrets in your GitHub repository.
- Adjust workflow settings in ci_cd_workflow.yml if needed.
- Push changes to the main branch to trigger the workflow.
# 7. Monitoring and Logging:
- Run python monitoring_and_logging/monitoring_setup.py to set up CloudWatch and CloudTrail.
# 8. Performance Evaluation:
- Update performance_evaluation_bleu.py with your model and baseline outputs.
- Run python performance_evaluation/performance_evaluation_bleu.py to calculate BLEU score.

# Usage Instructions:

# Model Deployment:
- Use the deploy_model.py script to deploy your text-generation model to SageMaker.
# Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment:
- Push changes to the main branch to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.
- The workflow will automatically run linting, testing, and deploy the model on AWS.
# Monitoring and Logging:
- Run the monitoring_and_logging/monitoring_setup.py script to configure CloudWatch and CloudTrail.
# Performance Evaluation:
- Update performance_evaluation_bleu.py with your model and baseline outputs.
- Run performance_evaluation/performance_evaluation_bleu.py to calculate BLEU score.

# Conclusion:
This file provides an overview of the project structure, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. Users can follow these steps to deploy, monitor, and evaluate a text-generation language model using AWS SageMaker, GitHub Actions, and Bleu performance metric. The README file serves as a central hub for documentation, helping users navigate the project effectively. Adjust the instructions based on specific project requirements and user needs.
